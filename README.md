# Mathematical Expression Solver
## Machine Learning Project
This is part of our Machine Learning Project at Trinity College Dublin

- Use the requirements.txt file to install the necessary libraries
- The dataset for re-training our models is available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14RE3JyYX-pYkvfboRQ_xTXG99wckY2Iq?usp=share_link
- unzip the test_images.zip before running detection on them

### To run inference and try the solution on any image, just use the Main Notebook.ipynb

### We have also added the training scripts and files inside final_codebase/training_phase/ that we used for training all three of our classification models.
